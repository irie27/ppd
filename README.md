Plex Playlist Downloader
This Python script was written with the help of Google Gemini.

The script connects to a Plex server using your Plex token.  You choose where the downloaded playlists are saved.
Once you make the initial connection, all of your playlists will be analyzed and listed with the number of items and total size.
You have the option to download a music or video playlist.  You select the playlist, then download it to the location you provided earlier.
You can see the progress of each individual file being download, as well as the overall progress of the transfer.

The playlists will not refresh as you switch from one to the other, unless you do it manually.
